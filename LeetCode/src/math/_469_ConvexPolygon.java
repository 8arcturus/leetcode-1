 * this polygon is convex (Convex polygon definition).
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points. Coordinates are in the range
 * -10,000 to 10,000. You may assume the polygon formed by given points is
 * always a simple polygon (Simple polygon definition). In other words, we

 * otherwise don't intersect each other.
